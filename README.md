# E-Learning-Plateform
An E-learning platform that is developed using the MERN stack during an internship. The platform will allow students to purchase a course and before purchasing it they can watch a video preview.


This platform will allow students to purchase a course, and before purchasing it they can watch a preview video about that course.
Courses will be in the form of videos and a PDF file that contains more information and tips about that course.


Payment will be through the post office, which is the first version of the payment feature in this project. A student after purchasing a course must visit the nearest post office in order to send money to the platform admin and after that, the student must provide the transaction number so the admin can verify the transaction and allow the purchase. This process will take at most 48h.


Further info will be added alongside other AMAZING features.
